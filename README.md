# Preparations for the 1st IHK exam

This repository should contain the things I use to prepare myself for the 
final exam part 1, provided by the "Industrie- und Handelskammer" (IHK), for
IT-specialists in training. 

All Documents are written in LaTeX. 

The folder `docs` contains general documents used for learning. The folder 
`tasks` contains example tasks to prepare for the exams and the folder 
`solutions` contains the solutions to the tasks.
